    /** Go Fish with data structures
     *
     * Rules, from Wikipedia:
     *
     * Five cards are dealt from a standard 52-card deck to each player, or seven
     * cards if there are four or fewer players. The remaining cards are shared
     * between the players, usually spread out in a disorderly pile referred to as
     * the "ocean" or "pool".
     *
     * The player whose turn it is to play asks another player for his or her cards
     * of a particular face value. For example Alice may ask, "Bob, do you have any
     * threes?" Alice must have at least one card of the rank she requested.
     * Bob must hand over all cards of that rank if possible. If he has none, Bob
     * tells Alice to "go fish" (or simply "fish"), and Alice draws a card from the
     * pool and places it in her own hand. Then it is the next player's turn – unless
     * the card Alice drew is the card she asked for, in which case she shows it to
     * the other players, and she gets another turn. When any player at any time has
     * all four cards of one face value, it forms a book, and the cards must be placed
     * face up in front of that player.
     *
     * Play proceeds to the left. When all sets of cards have been laid down in books,
     * the game ends. The player with the most books wins.*/
